        <div class="custom-space">
            <h3>Company History</h3>
            <p>
                <!Agro Nusantara was founded from a deep concern about the untapped potential of Indonesia’s trade sector. As one of the world’s richest countries in natural resources, agriculture, and local craftsmanship, Indonesia possesses strong economic potential. However, many local sellers especially MSMEs, farmers, small traders, and emerging companies continue to face significant challenges in accessing reliable buyers and navigating international trade systems safely.

Despite the quality and competitiveness of Indonesian products, limited market access, lack of transparency, and the risk of fraud in cross-border transactions have hindered many businesses from expanding globally.
Agro Nusantara was established as a digital trading platform designed to bridge this gap. Our mission is to connect Indonesian sellers with verified domestic and international buyers through a secure, transparent, and accountable system.
We believe that Indonesia’s low global trade competitiveness is not caused by weak products, but by structural barriers such as information asymmetry, limited global networks, and insecure transaction mechanisms. Therefore, Agro Nusantara was created to:

1. Open global market access for Indonesian MSMEs, farmers, traders, and corporations
2. Provide trusted sourcing solutions for importers
3. Implement transparent and traceable transaction systems
4. Reduce fraud risks in export–import activities
5. Promote export-import literacy and safe trade practices
Agro Nusantara is built upon the principle of economic empowerment. We are committed to improving the welfare of Indonesian businesses by creating a fair and secure digital trade ecosystem.
Through technology, transparency, and integrity, Agro Nusantara aims not only to facilitate transactions—but to build trust, strengthen competitiveness, and elevate Indonesia’s position in the global marketplace.>
